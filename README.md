<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](content.png)

This is a Frontend project where you have to create buttons for your website style guide.

- Where can I see your demo? You can check it on <a href="https://button-component.salo777.vercel.app/">
      Demo
    </a>
- What was your experience?
It was amazing, at the beggining I did a mess, but with the time you get more ideas on how to organize your icons and apply the style.
- What have you learned/improved? On how to create reusable components in other projects.
- Your wisdom? :) I need to practice more, but I'm on my way.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

<!-- This is an example, please update according to your application -->

To clone and run this application, you don't need something else rather than applying the different class styles on the demo

```bash
# Add the stylesheet to your HTML page
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://button-component.salo777.vercel.app/buttons.css">

# Copy and past the classes on your buttons
<button class="btn"/><button>

# You can increase or decrease the button size by adding 
"sm" = Small
"md" = Medium
"lg" = Large
```
